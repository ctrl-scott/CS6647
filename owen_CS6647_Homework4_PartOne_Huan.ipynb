        "1. Suppose you have three bills. Two are $10 bills and the other one is a $100 bill. Your friend puts each bill in a box. So one box has $100, and the other two boxes have $10 each. You pick a box, let's say box 1, then your friend who knows what's inside the boxes, opens another box, say box 3, which has a $10 bill. Do you want to stick your choice or switch to another box in order to get the $100 bill?  ( if the 100 is inside box 2 the friend must open box 3, but if the 100 is inside box 1 the friend can open either box 2 or 3.)"
